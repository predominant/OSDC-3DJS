# 3d Javascript Game Example #

This example was build during my presentation at [OSDC 2011](http://2011.osdc.com.au) entitled "Building 3D apps with Javascript".

## Slides ##

The accompanying slides are [hosted on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/predominant/building-3d-apps-with-javascript), though the meat of the talk was done in live coding.

## Running ##

Running locally on your machine, you will need:

* Node.js

Change into the `js` directory, and run:

	node server.js

Browse to the `index.html` file, in your browser (Don't use Chrome) and use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to navigate.
